# Types \[proposal\]

### List of prebuilt types:

### `string`

```text
let name = 'Mike'
```

### `int`

```text
let age = 29
```

### `float`

```text
let height = 189.3
```

### `array`

```text
let data: int[] = [1, 2, 3]
```

You don't need to declare variable type for basic types like numbers and strings - they are inferred automatically. Type declaration is necessary in complex data structures like `Arrays`, `Sets` etc.

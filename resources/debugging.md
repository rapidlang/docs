# Debugging

Thanks to `sourcemaps` `RAPID` can be debugged natively in the browsers dev tools. It's built with developers in mind - that's why you don't need to learn new tooling and new debugging practices.

{% hint style="info" %}
`sourcemaps` are only helpful in development environment while debugging. They are not included in production environment so the security is better and binary size is even smaller.
